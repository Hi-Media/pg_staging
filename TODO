What's next, doc?

== Important stuff

* londiste replication support
+
Auto-install londiste providers/subscribers from +replication.ini+
configuration file. This file is separated because the same database can act
both as a provider and a subscriber, or be a provider for more than one
subscriber, or be a subscriber for more than one providers.

* debian packaging

* +keep_bases+ implementation

* implement VACUUM ANALYZE <dbname> and add it post-restore

* add support for custom SQL script to run
+   
+pg_staging+ should be able to process custom SQL files, in a deterministic
order, from a given +sql_path+ configuration setup. All '+*.sql+ will be
processed from the client where +pg_staging+ is running, in alphabetical
order, subdirs ignored.

== Some ideas

* better "full size" scripting +#! /usr/bin/pg_staging+

  cat script.pgs | pg_staging
