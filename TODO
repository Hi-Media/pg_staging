What's next, doc?

== Important stuff

* londiste replication support
+
Auto-install londiste providers/subscribers from +replication.ini+
configuration file. This file is separated because the same database can act
both as a provider and a subscriber, or be a provider for more than one
subscriber, or be a subscriber for more than one providers.

* debian packaging

== Some ideas

* show command

  show <dbname> <parameter>

* better "full size" scripting +#! /usr/bin/pg_staging+

  cat script.pgs | pg_staging
