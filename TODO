== Important stuff

* londiste replication support
+
Auto-install londiste providers/subscribers from +replication.ini+
configuration file. This file is separated because the same database can act
both as a provider and a subscriber, or be a provider for more than one
subscriber, or be a subscriber for more than one providers.

* londiste replication: FK support
+
When starting londiste it happens that provider contains fresher data than
subscriber (autonomous backups), so recreating the Foreign Keys after the
initial COPY step is bound to fail. pg_staging should drop the FKs itself
first, have londiste COPY the data, then issue a +SELECT+ query to get
the provider rows to +DELETE+ and +DELETE+ them.

* londiste replication: subscriber tables / provider tables / pgqadm status

* debian packaging

* +keep_bases+ implementation

* implement VACUUM ANALYZE <dbname> and add it post-restore

== Some ideas

* better "full size" scripting +#! /usr/bin/pg_staging+

  cat script.pgs | pg_staging
