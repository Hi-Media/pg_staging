= pg_staging TODO

What's next, doc?

== Ongoing stuff

* new pitr command: restore from PITR (base backup + wal archives)

== Important stuff

* add examples now that the local setup is no more part of the distribution

== Convenience stuff

* have get/set support DEFAULT section (omiting the <dbname> part)

* Implement log_min_messages and client_min_messages and a logfile, for
  cases when you regret you were not using VERBOSE mode, and maybe some
  command to $PAGER the file (show log, catlog, log, logless, ...)

== Some ideas

* better "full size" scripting +#! /usr/bin/pg_staging+

  cat script.pgs | pg_staging
