= pg_staging TODO

What's next, doc?

== Ongoing stuff

* new pitr command: restore from PITR (base backup + wal archives)

== Important stuff

* add examples now that the local setup is no more part of the distribution

== Fixes and glitches

* at drop time, check for existing backends once pgbouncer is paused and
  terminate them

* createdb should care about pgbouncer setup

* load should use the path from the pg_staging config

* add support for loading contrib scripts

* londiste command should target latest restored database by default

* londiste command sometimes fails to do anything, debug

== Convenience stuff

* Implement log_min_messages and client_min_messages and a logfile, for
  cases when you regret you were not using VERBOSE mode, and maybe some
  command to $PAGER the file (show log, catlog, log, logless, ...)

* Add a copy schema command

* Add a rename schema command

* Add a post-shell command

== Some ideas

* better "full size" scripting +#! /usr/bin/pg_staging+

  cat script.pgs | pg_staging
